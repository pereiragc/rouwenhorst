* Rouwenhorst method

Discretizes a stable AR(1) with process with zero mean. Usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
include("rouwenhorst.jl")

npts = 10
rho = 0.9
sig = 0.01
gridpts, transition = rouwenhorst(npts, rho, sig)
#+END_SRC
where =rho= is the autocorrelation, =npts= is the number of points in the resulting discretized process, and =sig= is the /error/ standard deviation.
